Nicks Car Detailing

The business website for a new car detailing business in Ontario Canada and the first client of Leblanc Software Solutions. 

This will be to document for my portfolio and for others to see my coding style and my projects as i build them. This has no database or user information to be an issue for security concerns, so leaving the full code up is fine.


Website is built with Next.js. Pages are served by default as Static Generation and thus excellent for performance reasons and allows the ability later on to alter or add aditional more advanced features should the client request them down the line.


SEO is also greatly improved in this respect and allows for changing the meta tags for each page, and alleviates the issues with reacts SPA drawbacks for SEO seeing as the javascript bundles are executed after the google crawlers can see the full content of the page. This is my first project with Next js and I intend to use it much more often for most of my projects from now on. I love the versatility of it.
